Q,A
Is there a limit to the amount of characters in a message?,"On the platform, we display a character limit for every message. For example, a text message has a limit of 640 characters. This isn't a real limitation; you can still create a text message with more characters. It serves as an indication based on what Facebook Messenger will accept. So if you're using Messenger, it's a good idea to observe the character limit; otherwise your messages won't be posted in the user's conversation.
"
How can I add a message delay?,"You can add a delay of up to 5 seconds between each message in a group of messages.

The main reason for adding a delay is so that users have enough time to read the message before your bot sends the next one. In a chat interface, this is especially important because each new message moves the previous message up. Also, dropping several messages with no delay can feel a little â€¦ robotic! Another important reason for adding a delay is to give your bot personality. For example, you might want to add a short delay to make it look as though your bot is thinking! But be careful not to make your delays too long, so that users aren't waiting unnecessarily."
How do I delete my bot? ,"From within your bot, click on the settings button on the top right. Navigate to the ""Danger Zone"". Once in the danger zone select ""Delete bot"". "
How do I test my chatbot? ,"To test your chatbot navigate to the ""Chat with your bot"" bubble on the bottom right of your screen. From there, you can type in input as a user would and see the replies the bot would send. "
How do I change the matching strictness of my bot? ,"From within your bot, click on the settings button on the top right. Go to the bottom of the page where it says ""NLP"". Navigate to the ""Matching Strictness"" component. From there you will be able to configure a number between 0 to 100. The closer to 100 the more difficult it is for an intent to get triggered. "
How do I enable pronoun resolution? ,"From within your bot, click on the settings button on the top right. Go to the bottom of the page where it says ""NLP"". Navigate to the context management area and then click the box that says ""Resolve Pronouns"". "
What is pronoun resolution?,"Pronoun resolution allows you to map pronouns to their entities in the conversation history. It is off my default. When you turn the feature on it will automatically replace users pronouns with the words they were referring to. 
For example: My HR manager is Mike. I would like to book an appointment with him. In this case, him would be resolved to Mike. "
How do I reset the memory of my bot?,"To reset the memory of your bot follow the steps below. 
1. From within a skill, click on ""Update Conversation"". 
2. Then select ""Edit Memory"" from the drop down menu. 
3. See a checkbox in the top left corner that says ""Reset all memory"" 
4. Select that box and click save and your memory will be reset when a user finishes that action block
"
What are the standard languages?,"Our standard languages are Arabic, Catalan, Danish, Finnish, Hindi, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Norweigian, Dutch, Polish, Portugese, Russian, Swedish, and Chinese. If a language is standard that means that the bot has intent detection, custom entities, and language detection. "
